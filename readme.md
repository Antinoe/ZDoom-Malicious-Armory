# Malicious Armory

This is a weapon pack for Blue Savior's Project Malice, using Dwelling Sin as a base resource. I should note that this is not in a polished state yet.

### Credits
- The Brutal Doom Team for the M202 FLASH sprite.
- Realm667 for the rest of the weapon sprites.
- The G17 sprite is an edit of the Glock 18 seen on Realm667.
- I couldn't find the author for the Ballistic Vest and Outer Tactical Vest sprites. If anyone knows, please let me know.
- Blue Savior and the rest of the PM Team for Project Malice.
- And, of course, ID Software for Doom.
